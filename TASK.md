## Project: Real-time Task Management System

Create a real-time task management system with the following components and features:

### Backend (Node.js, Express, TypeScript):

1. Set up a Node.js project with Express and TypeScript.
2. Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
3. Use MongoDB for persistent storage of tasks and user data.
